Although Emms has supported lyrics out of box([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/manual/#Lyrics][Lyrics]]),
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'emms-lyrics)
  (emms-lyrics 1)
#+END_SRC
{{< param date >}}
{{< param weight >}}
but it only displays lyrics when there is lyric files in local directory.

find.exe outputs file path encoded in utf-8, so you must told emms-source-file-directory-tree-find
to use utf-8 parsing file pathes.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (advice-add
   'emms-source-file-directory-tree-find
   :around
   (lambda(orig &rest args)
	 (let (
		   (coding-system-for-read 'utf-8)
		   )
	   (apply orig args))))
#+END_SRC

Instead modify emms-source-file-directory-tree-find directly, I add advice to it to avoid repeating work when updated to the latest version of emms package 

* Auto download lyrics and pop out lyric buffer when download is done.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq emms-player-started-hook '
		((lambda ()
		   (lyrics-fetcher-show-lyrics
			nil
			:suppress-open t

				(emms-mode-line-alter)
				;; Only pop out lyrics buffer when emms playlist buffer is displayed.
				(when (get-buffer-window emms-playlist-buffer-name)
				  (save-selected-window
					(pop-to-buffer emms-lyrics-buffer)))
				;; 参考(emms-lyrics-toggle-display-buffer)
